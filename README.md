# User-List

The application consumes an API endpoint that retrieves a list of users and displays it. Also, this app pre-load the next page when there are 3 more items to display.
<br>
Ex: the list will be initialized with the first page of n results (20 in this example). When the user scrolls and the 17th item is displayed 
a call for loading a new page will be done. After 3 pages the process should stop, no more pages should be loaded.
